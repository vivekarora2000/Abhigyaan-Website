        </h2>

          <center>
            Abhigyaan is a volunteer organisation operating from BITS Pilani,
            Goa campus. It comprises of a group of highly motivated students
            working to help the not so privileged. Anyone and everyone
            interested in helping out is encouraged to volunteer during its
            events. With the active participation of the students, it has been
            able to achieve great feats in the past and aims to continue with
            the good work. It was back in the August of 2005 when Prof. T.C.
            Goel proposed an education drive with the aim to achieve the goal of
            "education for all" during his Independence Day address. Abhigyaan
            was started with this motto in mind by the students under the
            guidance of faculty-in-charge, Dr. Basavadatta Mitra in the same
            year. During it's humble initial days, Abhigyaan was a BITS Night
            School. The students taught the children of construction workers,
            the mess staff, the housekeepers and the maintenance staff. A mere
            total of 34 children were enrolled in its classes. Today, Abhigyaan
            has come a long way with the voluntary participation of nearly 120
            students of BITS Pilani, Goa campus. Members of Abhigyaan regularly
            visit the neighbouring slum of Lamani to teach and to play with the
            children. There are also programmes to teach children in the
            evenings and the the unfortunate, like the mess workers, at night on
            the campus. Various occasions like the Children's Day, the Republic
            Day and the Independence Day are celebrated with the underprivileged
            children. Last year, some of the volunteers also got an opportunity
            to teach the children how to dance and watched them perform during
            the opening ceremony of Waves'19, the annual cultural fest of
            college. Besides these, campus drives, like No Food Wastage Day, are
            organised regularly with an aim to reduce the overall weight of the
            food wasted by the students eating in the messes.

                  <small>
                    When I joined Abhigyaan, it was just a team of 50 highly
                    motivated people willing to give it back to the society. At
                    that time we had 5 different batches, inside and outside the
                    campus, where kids and adults came. I started teaching in
                    Mess Batch, where the mess workers took time from their
                    hectic schedule to learn a new language, or some basic
                    computer skills like MS office. Talking to them made me
                    realise that every person has his own struggle and his own
                    motivation to try and excel in life. Some were even trying
                    to clear their 12th board exams.
                  </small>
                  <br /><br />
                  <small>
                    In my second year I was made the batch head of the evening
                    batch, where the kids of non academic staff came. When I
                    joined Evening Batch there were just 2 kids. We went to
                    their neighbourhood and encouraged other parents to send
                    their kids. Within a few days the strength was around 20.
                    From then the graph went upwards. Recently, a girl from the
                    same batch secured 90.4% in 12th CBSE board exams.
                  </small>
                  <br /><br />
                  <small>
                    Over the years, I've seen Abhigyaan grow into a huge club
                    with 200 teachers and more than 100 students. Now, along
                    with the kids, their mothers also come to learn English and
                    Computers. People working in the library, cafeteria,
                    laundry, shopping complex, security guards have joined
                    Abhigyaan. Many security guards and mess workers also got
                    selected in the army and achieved higher ranks in their
                    respective jobs. Abhigyaan also teaches in the nearby slums
                    - Lamani and birla.
                  </small>
                  <br /><br />
                  <small>
                    Apart from assisting in academics, Abhigyaan celebrates
                    various events like children's day, independence day,
                    Republic day where kids from nearby slums and other kids
                    from campus come where we teach them the importance of these
                    days, conducts various competitions and play games.
                    Abhigyaan has also started a new initiative called "No food
                    wastage" where they encourage people not to waste food and
                    for at least a week keep their plates clean. This initiative
                    has proved to be very effective. The daily food wastage in
                    messes was brought down from 300ks to 90kgs.
                  </small>
                  <br /><br />
                  <small>
                    Abhigyaan is truly living up to their motto of "Education
                    for all" and I'm glad to be a part of it.

                    We can never payback our teacher and mentors, for standing
                    by and motivating us when we struggled, and in shaping us to
                    what we are.Only thing which we can do is to pay forward, by
                    helping others in a similar manner, and ABHIGYAAN is the
                    organization which helped me realise this fact and pushed me
                    for the same.Before ABHIGYAAN,every night when I was about
                    to sleep I felt a sense of emptiness about what I was doing
                    with my life.But the night after my first day at the
                    organisation,trying to teach Farhan, instead of the
                    emptiness, I felt that there was some kind of meaning being
                    added to my life and went to sleep happily.
                  </small>
                  <br /><br />
                  <small>
                    I felt that it was alright if I die after taking an
                    ABHIGYAAN session that would be one of my best days in life.
                  </small>

                  <small>
                    I joined the Evening batch of the organisation in my third
                    year, and I never missed playing football in till I joined
                    the club.But in my evening batch session, when I see the
                    smile on faces of the children,I could easily give up
                    football.They taught me to be more creative in teaching and
                    in life.Looking back,I think joining ABHIGYAAN was the best
                    decisions in life.

                  <h5>2015</h5>
                  <small>
                    I started working in Abhigyaan in my first year(2015). I was
                    assigned to the mess batch. And to be honest I was a little
                    nervous on the first day. But soon that nervousness turned
                    into excitement. We did a lot more than just studying, we
                    bonded and played games every week. Soon I started taking
                    substitute classes in other batches. And I realised that
                    teaching is totally different in every batch. Each batch has
                    a different age group or different background. The problems
                    faced are totally different in every batch. Some students
                    have a motivation problem in the long run, while some can't
                    stop running around during the class. But our constant
                    interaction helped a lot in keeping the morale up and the
                    kids also started listening to us. I have watched Abhigyaan
                    grow from a family of 60 to a family of 200 in my 4 years.
                    Abhigyaan has grown from 2-3 batches in my first year to 5-6
                    batches in my final year. Working in Abhigyaan opens our
                    eyes to the reality we never saw growing up in our homes. I
                    have seen mess workers coming for the classes after working
                    all day. I have seen some families in Lamani with around 500
                    rupees in their bank account. Whereas we spend more than
                    this on an outing or while ordering a pizza. The things we
                    take for granted are their once in a year celebration. So
                    after a while, you aren't just taking their classes because
                    they want to learn something. You take their classes because
                    you want them to learn something. You want them to succeed.
                    It becomes more than an Abhigyaan class. You take it upon
                    yourself to not let them down. Every time they succeed in
                    anything, like sending a whatsapp message for the first
                    time, you want them to take the next step. And trust me, an
                    extra sweet or ice cream in the mess from your student is
                    all you need for making you happy for the next few hours.
                    Apart from the official Abhigyaan activities, I have
                    innumerable unforgettable memories with the other members.
                    The bonds we create while working here are cherished by each
                    and every member. I wish Abhigyaan can keep growing and can
                    reach more people to create a lasting effect in their lives.
                    All the best to the current and future members. I'll keep
                    following the social media pages and smile everytime I see
                    anything about Abhigyaan.

                    One of my biggest joys is the fact that I didn’t bother much
                    about my academics or placements but followed my passion for
                    social service through Abhigyaan. I helped ensure that the
                    club’s teacher strength increased from 5 to over 20 during
                    my tenure as a coordinator. I continue to support the
                    volunteering community through my website -
                    VolunteerCurriculum.com. My BITS experience would not have
                    been half as enriching had I not worked with Abhigyaan,
                    weaving some of the best friendships. Whenever one visits
                    campus, time should be taken out to meet the Abhigyaan
                    teachers. You will not meet college students with a better
                    blend of humility, intellect and passion for social service
                    than the Abhigyaan teachers! I wish all the Abhigyaan
                    students and teachers continued success!

                    From going to call kids from their homes behind Ch-1 in the
                    evening, to being the bad cop to naughty kids, from cleaning
                    the Abhigyaan stationery cupboard, to giving disapproving
                    looks to people wasting food during No Food Wastage day, and
                    all of these make me smile with nostalgia even today. I
                    started with teaching a 10th class student in the evening
                    batch and then later taught Chiku in the Lamani batch. The
                    bonds I made while in Abhigyaan are so pure, that even after
                    graduating, Chiku and I are regularly in While I joined
                    Abhigyaan it meant nothing more to me than just another
                    experience at BITS. But today when I look back I feel that I
                    can join the dots. Abhigyaan was not just another activity
                    at BITS, but like a turning point in my life.

                    Unlike everyone whose journey starts with a club after
                    inductions, my journey with Abhigyaan started way before
                    inductions happened. It was just my second week on campus
                    when I first went to lamani with all the seniors for
                    Independence Day celebration. From just being a volunteer to
                    becoming the Project Lead and then finally the President, my
                    journey with Abhigyaan has been the most memorable and
                    important part of my college life. The fun and satisfaction
                    which I got as a first year volunteers to taking up the
                    responsibility of running the whole club is just something I
                    cannot describe in words. Almost all of the people whom I
                    met in my college is because of Abhigyaan and this family
                    not only consists of the BITsians but also each and everyone
                    who came to Abhigyaan for education. The happiness which I
                    felt after hearing the result of Anjali whom I taught was
                    much greater than seeing my 12th boards results. I just want
                    to end by saying that Abhigyaan had given me so much and
                    will always have a special place in my heart .

                    Hi, I am Sarthak, I joined Abhigyan back in 2017 and it has
                    been a truly memorable experience. I used to teach Math to
                    Anil and Sandeep, two engineering diploma students at Goa.
                    It gave me immense happiness after both of them passed with
                    flying colors. Both of them had a wonderful attitude for
                    learning and were amazing human beings. I remember being
                    admitted to hospital once in November 2017 and Sandeep
                    actually came and surprise-visited me which is one thing I
                    would never forget. It gives me immense pleasure to say that
                    one of them has actually started their own teaching class. I
                    shall always be grateful to Abhigyan to give me this
                    opportunity and an experience to remember forever.

                    I am so glad that I could find such a huge bunch of people,
                    who were as passionate about giving back as I was. I had
                    always wanted to join an NGO but never got the chance to.
                    Abhigyaan gave me that platform. I will always remember each
                    and every student I taught, from mischievous kids in the
                    evening batch, to the curious women of the housekeeping
                    batch. Every lesson with them was special and I don't think
                    any experience would outshine what I felt when my first
                    student managed to recite the alphabetical order perfectly
                    for the first time. I'm really thankful to the team of that
                    time, all before it and all that came after, for creating
                    such a positive atmosphere in the club. I hope that
                    Abhigyaan keeps going strong in the times to come.

                    Abhigyaan, it's not just a group of people, it's an
                    ideology. It's an idea that brings together people, empowers
                    people to empower the underprivileged.

                    A lot of my friends ask me, Why did I join Abhigyaan ??
                    Extracurriculars?? Soft Skills?? After 4 years, what exactly
                    did I gain from Abhigyaan. I tell them that the biggest
                    reward for me was to see the joy on the faces of the kids,
                    the hope on the faces of the staff workers. What else would
                    I need. I felt at peace knowing I had done something to make
                    a difference to the lives of someone.

                    When I joined Abhigyaan, I had just one thought in my mind.
                    As long as I was able to impact even a single person's life,
                    that would be enough for me.

                    batches, taught people of all age groups. It was an amazing
                    experience cuz while teaching them, I learnt a lot of things
                    from them too. Hard work, Perseverance, Being brave through
                    the tough times, Everyone had their own story and i was
                    lucky enough to be part of so many.

                    people to a huge group of even more amazing people. I'm sure
                    the coming batches will take Abhigyaan to even greater
                    heights and continue making this world a better place to

                    My experience in abhigyan was one of the best time of my
                    campus life. I have taught in almost all batches, and
                    everytime I went and taught anyone I always felt that I have
                    done something productive, even only if the class was just
                    for an hour. I enjoyed teaching in all the batches but my
                    favourite batch was the evening batch because the smile on
                    the kids face after they understand a concept is personally,
                    the best feeling ever. I will always be a part of abhigyan
                    and will always try to help anyone in need.

                    I still remember the reason why I joined Abhigyaan, all my
                    friends were talking about this great social club and I
                    thought it would be better to join along with friends. I
                    never thought the journey which started just as a mere
                    source of enjoyment would turn into a big part of my college
                    life. I never realised how seeing the smiles of small kids
                    became daily part of my life.

                  <br /><br />
                  <small>
                    What I found most unique about Abhigyaan was the dedication
                    and motivation of its members that were always trying to
                    create joy in other times, devoting so much of their time
                    into betterment of others. I was lucky to get such amazing
                    peers in my short period with Abhigyaan always made working
                    fun and were always ready to help you no matter what the
                    situation. Abhigyaan stands great on its values and I
                    believe what it is doing is very noble and anyone associated
                    with it should take pride over the impact they are creating
                    in other people’s life on a daily basis. It is always great
                    to see that the new people who are joining Abhigyaan are so
                    motivated to do more for the society.

                    My journey with Abhigyaan was unfortunately a small one
                    according to me and I will always take memories that I made
                    with the children, the mess workers and the other students,
                    my fellow club-mates and everyone that was associated with
                    the club. I did join the club with a small desire to make
                    some impact on other’s lives and I do hope that I was able
                    to do something for others. I joined the club with great
                    hopes and I hope that I’m ending my time leaving behind only
                    love and memories :)

                    I joined Abhigyaan in my first semester of college. I
                    started out with an attempt to establish the guards batch,
                    teaching a guard on SAC duty called Rahul Bhaiya who wanted
                    to prepare for the SSC exams. Those late nights preparing
                    for it with him are amongst my fondest campus memories. I am
                    still in contact with him via facebook and although he has
                    moved on to other things in his native state of Assam, he
                    maintains that the learnings and challenges faced during SSC
                    preparation have kept him in good stead. He tells me how he
                    proudly tells the stories of BITS and its students to the
                    kids in his village. He tells them about the life changing
                    scope of education. And looking back perhaps this small
                    experience of mine is what in essence Abhigyaan means to
                    every Bitsian fortunate enough to be a part of it. My time
                    with Abhigyaan brought me face to face with a life that I
                    always knew existed but was never aware of the everyday
                    struggles it carried with itself. Over the years the
                    interactions with guards, mess workers and slum dwellers
                    gave me insights into their lives and aspirations which
                    fuelled me to introspect upon my own dreams and aspirations.
                    And Luckily I got to gain these experiences amongst some of
                    the most warm-hearted and dedicated bunch of people in the
                    form of the Abhigyaan family. Abhigyaan is an absolute
                    credit to the BITS community and I hope it continues to
                    fulfil its mission with distinction.

                    My Abhigyaan experience started in my first year when I was
                    allotted for teaching in the hostel assistants batch.
                    Teaching Madhuri Madam English was my first experience of
                    teaching an adult. While teaching her, I understood how much
                    difficulty a person faces due to the inability to converse
                    in English. Madhuri ma'am, however, was so determined to
                    learn that every time she met me in the hostel, she made it
                    a point to ask the tell her a new English word.
                  </small>
                  <br /><br />
                  <small>
                    The evening batch of Abhigyaan is probably one of the most
                    fun batches to teach in. I was also lucky to get an
                    opportunity to teach there for nearly over 2 yrs. Laxmi was
                    my first student in the evening batch, who came to learn
                    Math and French. She was a bright student and was very
                    focussed. She often told me stories about her school and
                    friends, which made me relive my school days. Since I was
                    amongst the few teachers who knew Konkani, I got a chance to
                    teach the sister duo, Bhagyalaxmi and Vijaylaxmi. The two of
                    them were so sincere that they reminded me to give them some
                    homework at the end of every class. They always tried their
                    best to learn and often taught me a few words in Kanada.
                    Teaching in Abhigyaan has been a wholesome experience and is
                    something that has made a considerable part of my college
                    life.

                  <small>
                    Events in Abhigyaan have always been fun. Children's day
                    celebration is something that I looked forward to ever since
                    my first year. Jumping, dancing and playing games with the
                    kids was definitely a stress buster. Taking dance practices
                    for the kids from Lamani before the performance at Waves
                    Inauguration was an enjoyable experience. I even ended up
                    learning the floss dance from them. I cannot imagine my
                    college life without Abhigyaan and this experience is
                    something I will never forget.

                    A decade before I joined the BITS PILANI Goa and one of the
                    most satisfying things happened in my college life was
                    Abhigyaan. I still miss rushing to the houses of
                    construction workers everyday behind CH1 hostel after 5 PM
                    to fetch the kids for the evening batch and many times
                    convincing girls’ parents to let them come with us instead
                    of loading them with house chores.
                  </small>
                  <br /><br />
                  <small>
                    Abhigyaan was unique in our college in the sense that it was
                    neither a club nor department but rather an autonomous team
                    of self-motivating and passionate members making it a
                    family. I joined this family in 2011, my second year without
                    realizing much of its scope and impact. I worked with Ayush
                    bhaiya and Suhas bhaiya and got to learn more about the
                    Abhigyaan as a whole and it’s working while I was
                    contributing in the evening batch.

                  <small>
                    Next year, I was given the leadership role of coordinator to
                    take the legacy forward. I was thrilled but at the same time
                    was quite nervous about getting such a huge responsibility.
                    For the first time in my life, I was going to do something
                    which would impact somebody else’s life too. That thought
                    set deep in my mind and was the source of motivation
                    throughout. In addition to assuming an administration role,
                    I was well aware that the task would need very
                    well-coordinated team efforts. I was quite fortunate to get
                    very supportive, active, and super cool colleagues as
                    Harshali, Raghav bhaiya, Shreya, Bhavya, Jatin, Nishant,
                    Chirag, and Manchu(Aditya, if I’m correct :P).

                  <small>
                    Over the course of the next two years(2012-2013), we
                    stressed hard on expanding our reach and making sure that no
                    one is left uncovered on the campus. Our motto of “Education
                    for all” was well absorbed by juniors whose effect I could
                    see by myself. I was supported by a fantastic team of
                    juniors in the evening batch and all across Abhigyaan in
                    general. We made sure that we won’t just be teachers but
                    also mentors and friends who would help develop students’
                    personalities in total. We started a new night batch in the
                    Institute Cafeteria and a batch for women security guards in
                    girls’ hostels along with pre-existing batches: Evening
                    batch for kids, Night batch for mess workers and security
                    guards, CC batch to teach computers. I tried hard to go
                    outside the campus but faced many challenges so we got one
                    student Anil, who would come to the campus to study. But now
                    I’m elated to know that we have indeed expanded outside the
                    campus as well.
                  </small>
                  <br /><br />
                  <small>
                    Apart from expansion, I also focussed on making Abhigyaan a
                    brand on its own and not to be confused by Nirmaan among
                    BITSians so they could get more aware of Abhigyaan and its
                    working. Keeping that in mind we organized the logo
                    competition in 2013 which was won by Arnab Nandy and that’s
                    how our logo came into existence. ;) Also, we had organized
                    numerous fun events and discussions for everyone at the
                    campus so we could expand our reach, get noticed, and at the
                    same time ensure that our students participated in those
                    events to get exposure and have fun.

                  <small>
                    Abhigyaan family kept evolving and making all members
                    contribute in any way possible. Not to forget, we also had
                    some nice faculty members to lend out the support when
                    needed.

                    Since I’m writing after so long, lots of memories are
                    pouring in but just to make it readable, I’ll try to wind up
                    and maybe would share more sometime later.

                  <small>
                    I congratulate all current members for putting hard work and
                    continuing the awesome work. I feel fortunate and proud to
                    be associated with this family and to be a branch of this
                    ever-growing tree which has already completed 15 good years.

                    Lastly, I wanna say, Abhigyaan gave me the first opportunity
                    to look outside my privileged bubble into the real world.

                    "I never really thought I would connect with abhigyaan
                    students so well. I left my tuitions because I was scoring
                    below average in 11th grade. My main concern was basically
                    physics. After joining abhigyaan in January, I was abe to
                    understand most of the concepts of physics and also
                    chemistry. 12th grade, I was actually nervous chemistry
                    because organic; but Utkarsh bhaiya made everything so much
                    easier to understand and trust me, I used to hate physical
                    chemistry but now, not much. Malhar bhaiya and Abhinav
                    bhaiya thought me physics and made the derivations the
                    easiest. Thanks to gourav for telling me about muscular pigs
                    to explain about Biopiracy. I'm actually really glad that I
                    joined abhigyaan because I really don't think I would have
                    scored 90. I'd really like to thank abhigyaan for working on
                    me so much."

                    Avinash held down a full time job in the mobile shop next to
                    Malakars while also trying to prepare for his 12th Maths
                    Supplementary exam. With the help of our volunteers, he was
                    able to clear this exam and finally complete his 12th grade.
                    Abhigyaan wishes him success in all his future endeavours.
