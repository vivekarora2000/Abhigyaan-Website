                                 The donation drive, an initiative conducted jointly by Abhigyaan and Nirmaan, was aimed at helping out those in need. Boxes were placed outside every hostel on campus between May 1st and the 13th to allow the students of BITS Goa to contribute to the cause by donating notebooks & clothes which they didn't need any more. There was an overwhelming participation by the students making the drive an instant success. Unused and partially used pages were then collected from the aggregated notebooks to bind them into new notebooks for those in need of them. The distribution was a success as the recipients of the notebooks smiled brighter with every little contribution from the BITSians.

                                On 26th of Jan,Abhigyaan organised an event "Republic Day 2019 the way we know best"-which saw a massive participation of the kids from Lamani Batch, Evening Batch and the ladies from English Batch. Excitement was at a high throughout the afternoon as the kids spent time bonding with their teachers and students from other batches outside of their classrooms. Children drew pictures depicting the national leaders and the tricolour.With an aim to instill a sense of integrity in them,a cricket match was organised for the kids.The event came to an end as the students grouped together and shared their stories and food.In brevity, it was an afternoon, very well spent!

                                 Children’s Day is a day dedicated to the inimitability and pricelessness of youth. We at Abhigyaan, spent the day ensuring that the children have the best possible experience and happy memories to take back home. Students enjoyed the intimate interaction with their teachers and it was indeed, a much-needed pre-exam stress buster for us as well. From interactive guessing games andscreenings of their favourite animated movies in the academic block, to the lemon and spoon race for the little ones and cricket matches for the older ones, laughter and joy floated all around till late into the evening when reluctant students had to trudge back home. All in all, it was a day full of happy memories and smiles.
